== Introduction

LINES is a customizable publishing framework for Rails developers. It makes your publications and the processes around it simple and beautiful.

LINES is designed for mobile publishing needs. You work in a clear, responsive backend where you write with a distraction-free markdown editor, and where publishing your articles is dead simple. Readers enjoy your writing, not least because it’s perfectly readable on all screens. 

LINES is a framework for tech-savvies who care about writing and publishing, with the freedom of full OSS access.

=== Managing admin users

Currently, LINES does not offer a GUI for managing users, but you can use a rake task to do so:

  rake lines:add_user

To update an existing user, you’ll need the rails console with 'rails c'

 
=== UPDATE an existing user
  u = Lines::User.find_by(email: 'your@email.com')
  u.email = "new@mail.com"
  u.password = "newsekret"
  u.save


=== Google Sitemap

The sitemap_generator gem (https://github.com/kjvarga/sitemap_generator) handles the creation of site maps for search engines. To update the sitemap on server, run:

  bundle exec rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping # don’t ping search engines
  bundle exec rake sitemap:refresh         # ping search engines

Don’t forget to adjust the full URL to your sitemaps in <tt>public/robots.txt</tt>

== Customization


=== Copy/update stylesheets

Run <tt>rails g lines:copy_styles</tt> to install stylesheets from newer gem versions. Keep in mind to backup your overrides and other customizations before doing so!


=== Modify CSS/SCSS

Find the SASS files inside the <tt>app/assets/stylesheets/lines/</tt> directory. 

Use the <tt>app/assets/stylesheets/lines/lines_overrides.scss</tt> file to adjust existing styles or add new ones.

=== Modify custom hero images

You can change, remove, or add the +HERO_IMAGES+ variable inside the <tt>config/lines_config.yml</tt> file. The corresponding images reside inside the <tt>public/heroes</tt> directory.


=== Header (Meta) & Footer

To change the header/meta/footer elements you need to modify <tt>app/views/layouts/lines/application.html.erb</tt> and the corresponding partials.
